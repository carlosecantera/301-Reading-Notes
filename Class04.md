## React Docs - Forms
- What is a 'Controlled Component'?

**Controlled componenets are two elements that are combined by making the React state be the "single source of truth.**
- Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why? 
 **I would assume that we would want the information stored immediately because the users has the ability to change it later.**
- How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field? **We would use the `event.target.name`
