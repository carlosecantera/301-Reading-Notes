What is functional programming? **Functional programming is a style of building the structure and elements of programs.**
What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function? **A pure function returns the same result if given the same arguments and doesn't cause any observable side effects.**
What are the benefits of a pure function? **It makes it easier to test code**  
What is immutability? **The state of the data cannot be changed after it has been created**
What is Referential transparency?
**This is when a function cosistently yeilds the same result for the same input**
What is a module? **Small part of code that does a specific thing and can be called on its own. Or more simplely another JS file**
What does the word ‘require’ do? **It allows you to use a function anywhere in the application but it has to be global.**
How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in? **Use require**
What do we have to do to make a module available? **module.exports = "whatever the modules name is"**
